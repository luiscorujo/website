                My fascination with engineering and science traces back to my childhood,
                where my love for computers ignited during countless hours immersed in video games.
                As I grew older, this passion seamlessly evolved and it continues to thrive today.

                These days, I enjoy the challenges from my job at AWS.
                Problem-solving is not just a job requirement but a source of satisfaction for me.
                I thrive when presented complex issues and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
                Beyond the workplace, I'm curious about the latest trends in AI and advances in space exploration. ðŸš€

                Away from the screens, I am an adventurer at heart, always seeking the thrill of adrenaline.
                I'm a certified scuba diver and skydiver. I run marathons, and I love the mountains,
                whether it's snowboarding down their slopes or hiking to their peaks.
